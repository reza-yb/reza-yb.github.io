I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology and an MBA from the University of Tehran. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer and Quantitative Financial Analyst at Cobblestone in Dubai, UAE.

My primary research interests include Applied Machine Learning, ML in Finance, AI for Healthcare, and AI for Social Good. I have been involved in several projects and publications, particularly in finance and healthcare.

I am always enthusiastic about the opportunity to collaborate on innovative projects. I invite you to explore my work and connect with me for potential collaborations or discussions in AI and machine learning.
